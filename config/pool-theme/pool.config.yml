# COMMUNITY POOL CONFIGURATION
# =============================================
#
# This is the ONLY file you need to edit to customize your pool.
# Change values below, then run: docker compose up --build
# Your pool will rebuild with your branding, colors, and settings.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments — they're ignored.
# Don't remove the keys (the words before the colons).
